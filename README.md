# **PRO(TECH)T - A Feminist Chatbot and Manifesto**

# **The concept and design summary for PRO(TECH)T**

During the summer of 2021, I had been speaking with my friend Caitlin Monohan about collaborating together to create a feminist chatbot. We met a few times to discuss our ideas… so when I started the MA Internet Equalities course and saw that our brief for the Feminist Coding Practices unit was to create a feminist chatbot, it all started coming together. Caitlin and I both identity as female and are in circles of friends where the majority identify as female and gender minorities. Therefore, we wanted to create a feminist chabot for people of these identities. From speaking with a lot of our friends and other people of these identities that we’ve met online, we discovered a concern amongst people of these identities for their safety, comfort and confidence in digital spaces. It also felt like once we opened up this conversation with people, they felt so comforted that others felt the same and felt a release from discussing these feelings and dreaming together of how it could (and should) be better. 

Consequently, we came up with the idea to name our bot PRO(TECH)T, playing on the word ‘protect’. The purpose of the bot is to provide a safer space for people who identify as female and gender minorities to express their feelings about existing in digital spaces and to collectively dream of more equitable and comfortable futures together. The prior part being enacted through the conversation with the bot and the latter part being enacted through all of the users collaborating together to create a manifesto for an alternative future. When the user first interacts with the bot they are alerted that by clicking ‘enter’ and speaking with the bot, they agree for their answers to be collected in the ‘Manifesto’ page for themselves and all other users of the bot to see. The ‘Manifesto’ page will make all of the data collected accessible to everyone and will act as an evolving manifesto created in collaboration with all of the users that PRO(TECH)T meets. The idea to incorporate a manifesto into the project came from my work on the Methods for Equitable Technology Development (MFETD) unit and Intersectional Internets (II) unit where I’ve been researching info intersectional feminist and punk HCI and the significance of manifestos within these concepts.

To create the bot, we followed the feminist framework for designing digital artefecats that I hypothesised in my MFETD submission and adopted a DIY approach, creating our own bot from scratch rather then editing existing code. Caitlin and I assessed that we are not professional coders and sought to collaborate with people joint in our values who could help us create the bot, so we collaborated with Tobi and Lach to code the bot. To follow the principle of intersectionality outlined in the framework, we made sure that our group of collaborators represented an intersection of identities.  We also carried out user testing at different stages throughout the production process, with people who identify as female and gender minorities, actioning their feedback into changes. 

To integrate accessibility into the bot, we researched trauma-informed design and adopted its advice for a calming and caring aesthetic, leading us to the colour gradients. The colours of the background also augment on each answer page in reaction to the sentiment of the user’s previous answer, using basic AI sentiment analysis.

Additionally, we integrated different kinds of responses for answers including free field, one choice and multiple choice to cater for different abilities and preferences. We also used all lower case type which is often easier to digest for people with dyslexia. Furthermore, we enabled an emoji reaction for some answer responses as they can be said to be more accessible than the words of the english language.
